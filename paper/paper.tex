\begin{abstract}
eBPF is a new technology which allows dynamically loading pieces of code into the Linux kernel. For example, it can greatly speed up networking since it enables the kernel to process certain packets without the involvement of a user space program. So far eBPF has been used for simple packet filtering applications such as firewalls or Denial of Service protection. We show that it is possible to develop a flow based network intrusion detection system based on machine learning entirely in eBPF. Our solution uses a decision tree and decides for each packet whether it is malicious or not, considering the entire previous context of the network flow. We achieve a performance increase of over 30\% compared to the same solution implemented as a user space program.
